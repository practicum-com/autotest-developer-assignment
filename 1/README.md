# Task 1 (HTML/CSS)

## Student task

Set the height of `100vh` for the `div` element with the `content`  class.

### Repository structure

The `pre` folder contains the initial task code. The `post` folder contains the correct solution. Your code must be placed in the `__test__/index.js` file.

## Your task

1. Write a list of things to check in the student code.
2. Write the tests according to this list.

All your work should be placed in the `__test__/index.js` file. Your code should add student errors to the `errors` array. The errors should be formatted as arbitrary strings (for example: "An incorrect value was applied for the height property of the `div` element"). If the code in the `index.html` file is correct, the array after the tests must remain empty. If the code is incorrect, there should be errors in the array. You can check your code in the console in the `pre/index.html` and `post/index.html` files.

### Note

- The tests should work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge, IE11.
- The IDE may have other stylesheets connected. However, they wonâ€™t affect student code.
